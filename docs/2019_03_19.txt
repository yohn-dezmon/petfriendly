Questions:

1. How do I get the css file to refer to a specific html file?
oh I think I have to have the <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="static/pet_friend.css">
set up! :D



TO DO:

Finish setting up thank_u.html page (by finishign the template inheritance and
also by finishing the css set up! :D)

Fix pet_friend.html so it's not redundant in reference to the template...


Updates:

1. added layout html
2. added simple form
3. updated pet_back_end.py a bit to eventually correspond to the thank_u.html page.
4. read about POST (to server) and GET (to server or to client/browser)
5.
