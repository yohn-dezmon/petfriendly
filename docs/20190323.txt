OK I'm frustrated b/c I've followed so many tutorials but I keep getting stuck
at the point where I need to actually connect to the database/create tables in the database.

I am not doing this successfully.

It's difficult because most tutorials do not have my exact setup so I'm trying to pick and choose
what makes sense from those tutorials.

I'm going to use this tutorial now b/c it seems like the setup most similar to what I have...

THIS IS HOW YOU ADD A DATABASE_URL in TERMINAL (After you've created the db in psl):
$ export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://localhost/wordcount_dev"



**
setting up .env file... (******AUTOENV*****)
https://realpython.com/flask-by-example-part-1-project-setup/
**

To set up our application with environment variables, we’re going to use autoenv.
This program allows us to set commands that will run every time we cd into our
directory.


by adding export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://localhost/fans"
everytime we cd into this direcotry, it should connect to the fans db! :D


Alembic is part of Flask-Migrate to manage database migrations to update a database's schema...


After you run the database initialization you will see a new folder called “migrations” in the project. This holds the setup necessary for Alembic to run migrations against the project.


AFTER THE MIGRATION THING, THE DB IS NOW READY FOR USE IN OUR APP, WTF YES! :D

You first need to connect to the db in psql! :D

\d >>>> this shows you the details of your table! (the columns)
** If your table has capital letters, you need escaping in psql for it to parse it correctly

i.e.
fans=# \d+ "FanInfo"

********* FIXING A CIRCULAR IMPORT ********

----------------------

Question:

When you create a db using psql in the command line, how do you know which server
you are making that db on?

Notes on psql:
https://chartio.com/resources/tutorials/how-to-list-databases-and-tables-in-postgresql-using-psql/

postgres is the default database that you connect to when first connecting to postgresql

you can change the database you are connected to by using \c or \connect

i.e.

HomeFolder=# \c fans
You are now connected to database "fans" as user "HomeFolder".

Once you've connected to a db, you can see which tables are there

\dt

fans=# \dt
          List of relations
 Schema |  Name   | Type  |  Owner
--------+---------+-------+----------
 public | FanInfo | table | postgres

Ideas to improve the website:
1. Create another form that asks what they think of the music
2. disable the download button from the players
3. Figure out how to setup a contact group from a database ... to make a distribution/mailing list.
4. Put a header on top of the form for the mailing list :D
