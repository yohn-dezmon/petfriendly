he said to run this after creating the .env file and config.py file

$ echo "source `which activate.sh`" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc

WHAT DOES THIS DO THOUGH???
this refreshes the bashrc

WHAT IS A bashrc FILE??
.bashrc is a shell script that Bash runs whenever it is started interactively.
It initializes an interactive shell session.
You can put any command in that file that you could type at the command prompt...
wait which file?!?!?!
the bashrc file...
but wtf I never made a bashrc file...


WHAT DOES echo DO?
not exactly sure... it returns things and exectures other things echo [options] [string]
