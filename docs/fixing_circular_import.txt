https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37871945/failing-to-import-class-from-models-py

since my models.py file imports db from the pet_back_end
I had to put from models import Fans within the if name



if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
    from models import Fans


Instead of at the top of the document like usualy :D :D :D
