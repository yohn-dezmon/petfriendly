We'll do this by adding an HTML form that passes information from the front-end of
our application (what our users see), through Flask, and to the back-end (our Python code).


Notes on <form>:

the action attribute specifies which URL to send data to once the form has been submitted.
name > specifies the name fo the form.

Notes on <input>:

type > there are many options available, it is the datatype. for name I'm using text
for email there is a specific email datatype.
if the type is 'submit', this creates a submit button! whaa...
alternatively you can use <button> and set its type to submit, and this also creates a submit button.

Notes on <button>:

from the xample, it looks like the text displayed on the button goes between the beginning
and end tags. In comparison with <input>, where you set the value attribute equal to 'the text you
want displayed on the button'.
