Files from this tutorial:
1. models.py
2. config.py
3. crud.py

Ok I think I need to run these sequentially...



To create tables, or models, with SQA we create a Python class with the fields that
define the table, then ask SQA to build those models in our database


We need to inherit Base in order to register models with SQA. Without this,
SQA wouldn't know anything about our models


We need a driver called psycopg2 (pip install psycopg2) to let SQA obtain a
connection to Postgres.


In order to connect to this database in Python you will need to remember:

The name of the database - books in our case
The port - defaults to 5432
The username - defaults to postgres
The password you used when creating the server [what was this? either postgres or jesmonddohn]


Notice we defined the __repr__ data model. As you'll see later, this will make it more obvious what row of the database we're printing out.


CONNECTING TO POSTGRES WITH PYTHON:

please see config.py


# my username is postgres
# my password is jesmonddohn
# the IP address is localhost (127.0.0.1)
# the port is 5432
# and the database name is fans.
