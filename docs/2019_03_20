UPDATES:

1. I've updated the if request.form == POST portion of my python to be compatible with the
SQLite db/SQLAlchemy.

QUESTIONS:

1. How to have something float in the center?

--
Now we are creating the DB in the python shell (since we only need to do it once!).

>>> form pet_back_end import db
>>> db.create_all()
>>> exit()

--
For future reference here is how you query the db

PYTHON:
# this goes inside your flask method ...
books = Book.query.all()
   return render_template("home.html", books=books)

HTML:

<h1>Books</h1>
    {% for book in books %}
      <p>{{book.title}}</p>
    {% endfor %}
